# Compiler-to-Abstract-Machine-for-Language-Engineering
The aim of this coursework is to implement a simple programming language by compiling it to assembly code for an abstract machine. You will be provided with an assembler and emulator for the specified abstract machine, enabling you to run and debug programs that you have compiled.

The language specs can be found [here](language.html). For more info on what has been implemented in addition to the initial language specs please read [REPORT](REPORT)

In addition, the denotational semantics of the language is implemented [here](cwk2.hs) in Haskell. It allows for whole programs to be represented as Haskell terms.
